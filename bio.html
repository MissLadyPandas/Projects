<section>Katharine Eilene Brumback was born in Bath, Maine to Leonida V Brumback, a housekeeper in a major hospital, and Kenneth E Brumback, an engineer at the US Postal Service. She is an actress known for The Green Eyed Man (2021), Off The Record (2021), and Act of Faith (2021)

Graduating in 2009 from Morristown Jr. Sr High School, she attended the Art Institute of Indianapolis with dreams of becoming an animator.  She completed only two semesters before reality of not making enough money to sustain school became apparent. Katharine made the decision to enter the work force and teamed up with Office Team working miscellaneous temp jobs ranging from data entry, customer service clerk, etc…

As of 2021 Katharine is attending the Ivy Tech College in Indianapolis, IN working on a Web Developer Degree. She also is with the acting coach of Lee Dario of TIG Media House where she is improving her acting and voice acting capabilities. 

Extremely bright, motivational, and full of spirit Katharine Brumback practices the acting techniques of Uta Hagen - a variation of emotional recall with clear parameters and “imaginative extension of realities”.  Life is full of surprises, whatever will be WILL be.  She considers herself a forever student with a hunger for constant knowledge of culture and philosophy. Her determination is relentless and will never give up achieving what others say is impossible.
